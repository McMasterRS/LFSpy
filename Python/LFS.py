# class stub for interfacing with scikit learn pipeline.
# Fit, transform, and fit_transform methods are required

# gamma:   impurity level (default: 0.2)
# tau:     number of iterations (default: 2)
# sigma:   controls neighboring samples weighting (default: 1)
# alpha:   maximum number of selected feature for each representative point
# NBeta:   numer of distinct \beta (default: 20)
# NRRP:    number of iterations for randomized rounding process (defaul 2000)
